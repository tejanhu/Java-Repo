Unit 5

Explaining concepts



Explain what is meant by the following concepts, using Java programming examples to illustrate your answer:

Array:

A fixed-size object that can hold zero or more items of the 
array's declared type.

Examples: 

For example: String[0]="betty";


Array index:


Examples: 

Array Declaration:

When a variable is declared without the need for it to be declared individually.
They are declared and processed using a for loop which looks at each element
in the array.

Examples: 

Search Algorithms:

Algorithms for finding items with specified properties among a collection of items.

Examples: 

Linear Search:

A type of search algorithm which is used to find a particular value in a list,
which consists of every one of its elements, one at a time and in sequence,
until the desired one is found.

Examples: 

(Scenario): Paul finding a specific person on the register who hasn't signed in.


Binary Search:

A type of search algorithm which is used to find the position of a 
specified input value(the search "key") within an array sorted by key value.

Examples:

(Scenario):
Ascending order:
0,1,2,3,4,5

5,1,2,4,3,0 ask for each digit(are you bigger?)[if yes, then swap]
