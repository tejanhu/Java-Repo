Explaining concepts



Explain what is meant by the following concepts, using Java programming examples to illustrate your answer:

Type:

A type is a format of values that can be stored in a variable.

Examples: 

For example, an integer type declares that a variable can only store integer values.
i.e. int ....//can only store integer values

String:

A String is a data type that holds a word, or a few words, or a mixture
of characters which are in between quotes.

Examples: 

For example, String water; //water is the String variable
             water = "Stillwater"; //"Stillwater" is the String value

Assignnment:

An Assignment is a process where a variable is given a value.

Examples: 

For example,
nationality="Gambian"//"Gambian"; is the value of the String variable nationality

Name:

A name is an identifier that is used for a variable in the memory.

Examples: 

Boolean:

A boolean is a data type which gets either the value true or false.

Examples: 

For example, 
true; 
false;

Integer variable:

An integer variable is when a variable declares it's 
data type to be an integer value.

Examples: 

For example, int f;

String variable:

A String variable is when a variable declares 
it's data type to be a String, therefore containing
a value which is a String.

Examples: 

For example, String countries;

Integer assignment:

An integer assignment is when a variable gets the value of an
integer.

Examples: 

For example, id=101112;

Function:

A function is a block of code which returns a value.

Examples: 

For example, a method which returns a data type of a String, as shown below:

public static String cedric()
{
    int x = 1;
    String a = "ahfhdas";
    
    return a;
}// END cedric

Procedure:

A procedure is a block of code which doesn't return a value.

Examples: 

For example, a method which doesn't return any data type as shown below:

public static void Paper()
{
    int x=1;
    String a ="hhh";
    System.out.println(x);
    System.out.println(a);
}//END paper

Expression:

An expression is a combination of operands and operators that produces a
resulting value. Expressions have a resulting type, that affects the context
in which may be used.

Examples: 

Integer expression:

An Integer expression is a combination of operands and operators that produces an integer value.

Examples: 

String expression:

A String expression is an expression whose result is of type String.

Examples: 

i.e. producing a value of characters.
e.g: name + "is mad"
System.out.println(name + "is mad");

Boolean expression:

A boolean expression is an expression whose result is of type boolean, i.e.
gives a value of either true or false. Operators such as && and || take 
boolean operands and produce a boolean result. The relational operators
take operands different types and produce boolean results.

Examples: 

e.g.: 
if(food.equals("bugs"&&|"maggts"))
{
    total > count + 5;
}
