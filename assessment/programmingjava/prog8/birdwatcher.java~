//This program demonstrates the use of methods within arrays, which has done by creating a program which logs the type and number of birds seen a user in the garden which is then stored and results printed once quited.

class birdwatcher
{
	static final int birds=5;//Static final variable given which can be used throughout program
	
	public static void main (String[]param )//Runs main method and runs all other methods

		boolean ans= true;//While true the while loop runs until it is false
